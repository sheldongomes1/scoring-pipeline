# Superpowers Reviews

Covers six review and execution workflow skills: Requesting Code Review, Receiving Code Review, Verification Before Completion, Finishing a Development Branch, Executing Plans, and Dispatching Parallel Agents.

---

## Requesting Code Review (superpowers-requesting-code-review)

Dispatch a code-reviewer subagent to catch issues before they cascade.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

### When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**
- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**
- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

### How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**
```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Dispatch code-reviewer subagent** using template at `code-reviewer.md`

**Placeholders in the template:**
- `{WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED}` — What you just built
- `{PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS}` — What it should do
- `{BASE_SHA}` — Starting commit
- `{HEAD_SHA}` — Ending commit
- `{DESCRIPTION}` — Brief summary

**3. Act on feedback:**
- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

### Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:** Review after EACH task. Catch issues before they compound.

**Executing Plans:** Review after each batch (3 tasks). Get feedback, apply, continue.

**Ad-Hoc Development:** Review before merge or when stuck.

### Red Flags

**Never:**
- Skip review because "it's simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:** Push back with technical reasoning. Show code/tests that prove it works.

See template at: `code-reviewer.md`

## Receiving Code Review (superpowers-receiving-code-review)

### Overview

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance.

**Core principle:** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.

### The Response Pattern

```
WHEN receiving code review feedback:

1. READ: Complete feedback without reacting
2. UNDERSTAND: Restate requirement in own words (or ask)
3. VERIFY: Check against codebase reality
4. EVALUATE: Technically sound for THIS codebase?
5. RESPOND: Technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. IMPLEMENT: One item at a time, test each
```

### Forbidden Responses

**NEVER:**
- "You're absolutely right!" (explicit CLAUDE.md violation)
- "Great point!" / "Excellent feedback!" (performative)
- "Let me implement that now" (before verification)

**INSTEAD:** Restate the technical requirement. Ask clarifying questions. Push back with technical reasoning if wrong. Just start working (actions > words).

### Handling Unclear Feedback

```
IF any item is unclear:
  STOP - do not implement anything yet
  ASK for clarification on unclear items

WHY: Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.
```

**Example:**
```
Human: "Fix 1-6"
You understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.

❌ WRONG: Implement 1,2,3,6 now, ask about 4,5 later
✅ RIGHT: "I understand items 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before proceeding."
```

### Source-Specific Handling

**From your human partner:** Trusted — implement after understanding. Still ask if scope unclear.

**From External Reviewers:**
```
BEFORE implementing:
  1. Check: Technically correct for THIS codebase?
  2. Check: Breaks existing functionality?
  3. Check: Reason for current implementation?
  4. Check: Works on all platforms/versions?
  5. Check: Does reviewer understand full context?

IF suggestion seems wrong: Push back with technical reasoning
IF conflicts with prior decisions: Stop and discuss with human partner first
```

### YAGNI Check for "Professional" Features

```
IF reviewer suggests "implementing properly":
  grep codebase for actual usage

  IF unused: "This endpoint isn't called. Remove it (YAGNI)?"
  IF used: Then implement properly
```

### Implementation Order

```
FOR multi-item feedback:
  1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST
  2. Then implement in this order:
     - Blocking issues (breaks, security)
     - Simple fixes (typos, imports)
     - Complex fixes (refactoring, logic)
  3. Test each fix individually
  4. Verify no regressions
```

### When To Push Back

Push back when:
- Suggestion breaks existing functionality
- Reviewer lacks full context
- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)
- Technically incorrect for this stack
- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist
- Conflicts with human partner's architectural decisions

**Signal if uncomfortable pushing back out loud:** "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"

### Acknowledging Correct Feedback

```
✅ "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
✅ "Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
✅ [Just fix it and show in the code]

❌ "You're absolutely right!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ ANY gratitude expression
```

**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it.

### GitHub Thread Replies

When replying to inline review comments on GitHub, reply in the comment thread (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{id}/replies`), not as a top-level PR comment.

### Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Performative agreement | State requirement or just act |
| Blind implementation | Verify against codebase first |
| Batch without testing | One at a time, test each |
| Avoiding pushback | Technical correctness > comfort |
| Partial implementation | Clarify all items first |

## Verification Before Completion (superpowers-verification-before-completion)

### Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

### The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

### The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim
```

### Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |

### Red Flags — STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

### Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
❌ "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Requirements:**
```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
❌ Trust agent report
```

### Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |

### The Bottom Line

**No shortcuts for verification.** Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

## Finishing a Development Branch (superpowers-finishing-a-development-branch)

### Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

### The Process

#### Step 1: Verify Tests

```bash
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:** Show failures. Stop. Do not proceed to Step 2.

#### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

#### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

#### Step 4: Execute Choice

**Option 1: Merge Locally**
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>
<test command>  # verify tests on merged result
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

**Option 2: Push and Create PR**
```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

**Option 3: Keep As-Is**
Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."
Don't cleanup worktree.

**Option 4: Discard**
Confirm first:
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```
Wait for exact confirmation before deleting.

#### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree (Options 1, 2, 4 only)

```bash
git worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

### Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | ✓ | — | — | ✓ |
| 2. Create PR | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| 3. Keep as-is | — | — | ✓ | — |
| 4. Discard | — | — | — | ✓ (force) |

### Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without typed "discard" confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

## Executing Plans (superpowers-executing-plans)

### Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute tasks in batches, report for review between batches.

**Core principle:** Batch execution with checkpoints for architect review.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

### The Process

#### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically — identify any questions or concerns
3. If concerns: raise with human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: create TodoWrite and proceed

#### Step 2: Execute Batch (default: first 3 tasks)

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

#### Step 3: Report

When batch complete:
- Show what was implemented
- Show verification output
- Say: "Ready for feedback."

#### Step 4: Continue

Based on feedback:
- Apply changes if needed
- Execute next batch
- Repeat until complete

#### Step 5: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

### When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

### Remember

- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Between batches: just report and wait
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- **Never start implementation on main/master without explicit user consent**

### Integration

**Required before starting:** superpowers:using-git-worktrees (set up isolated workspace)

**After all tasks:** superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch

## Dispatching Parallel Agents (superpowers-dispatching-parallel-agents)

### Overview

When you have multiple unrelated failures (different test files, different subsystems, different bugs), investigating them sequentially wastes time. Each investigation is independent and can happen in parallel.

**Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently.

### When to Use

**Use when:**
- 3+ test files failing with different root causes
- Multiple subsystems broken independently
- Each problem can be understood without context from others
- No shared state between investigations

**Don't use when:**
- Failures are related (fix one might fix others)
- Need to understand full system state first
- Agents would interfere with each other (editing same files)

### The Pattern

#### 1. Identify Independent Domains

Group failures by what's broken:
- File A tests: Tool approval flow
- File B tests: Batch completion behavior
- File C tests: Abort functionality

Each domain is independent — fixing one doesn't affect others.

#### 2. Create Focused Agent Tasks

Each agent gets:
- **Specific scope:** One test file or subsystem
- **Clear goal:** Make these tests pass
- **Constraints:** Don't change other code
- **Expected output:** Summary of what you found and fixed

#### 3. Dispatch in Parallel

```typescript
// All three run concurrently
Task("Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts failures")
Task("Fix batch-completion-behavior.test.ts failures")
Task("Fix tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts failures")
```

#### 4. Review and Integrate

When agents return:
- Read each summary
- Verify fixes don't conflict
- Run full test suite
- Integrate all changes

### Agent Prompt Structure

Good agent prompts are:
1. **Focused** — one clear problem domain
2. **Self-contained** — all context needed to understand the problem
3. **Specific about output** — what should the agent return?

```markdown
Fix the 3 failing tests in src/agents/agent-tool-abort.test.ts:

1. "should abort tool with partial output capture" - expects 'interrupted at' in message
2. "should handle mixed completed and aborted tools" - fast tool aborted instead of completed
3. "should properly track pendingToolCount" - expects 3 results but gets 0

Do NOT just increase timeouts — find the real issue.

Return: Summary of what you found and what you fixed.
```

### Common Mistakes

**❌ Too broad:** "Fix all the tests" — agent gets lost
**✅ Specific:** "Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts" — focused scope

**❌ No constraints:** Agent might refactor everything
**✅ Constraints:** "Do NOT change production code"

**❌ Vague output:** "Fix it"
**✅ Specific:** "Return summary of root cause and changes"

### Verification After Agents Return

1. **Review each summary** — understand what changed
2. **Check for conflicts** — did agents edit the same code?
3. **Run full suite** — verify all fixes work together
4. **Spot check** — agents can make systematic errors

### Key Benefits

1. **Parallelization** — multiple investigations simultaneously
2. **Focus** — each agent has narrow scope
3. **Independence** — agents don't interfere
4. **Speed** — 3 problems solved in time of 1
